The project was made for the detection of brain tumors in MRI images

Run the program in your IDE and input the path file for the MRI image in the CLI. You can choose either of the images provided in the no/yes folders 
or upload one from your system

Future Plans-
Develop a frontend using flask to make it into a proper application where you can take pictures/upload images
and the model can detect if its a tumor or not

Further Development in this field-
Develop a image segmentation model for brain MRI images for also segmenting the location of the tumor with high accuracy
